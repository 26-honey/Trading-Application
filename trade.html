        <h2>sweaters</h2>
        <p>The sweater is a piece of garment that covers the torso and arms. There are various options of different styles and cuts of sweaters â€“ some sweater models cover the neck of the wearer, some are designed with buttons like a waistcoat, some are made with zip neck or designed with zip from top to bottom, and some models are made with a polo neck or v-neck.
In addition to different models, sweaters are made from different materials in order to be worn in different seasons. They can be made from wool, cashmere, vicuna, cotton, silk, or a blend of these materials. Furthermore, sweaters can be woven thick or thin in terms of the weather conditions and regions where they are worn.</p>
